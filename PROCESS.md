*Whatâ€™s in your fridge?*

#### Day 1
Made a proposal for my app idea. At first I had this idea with personalizing cakes but couldn't find a fitting API for cake recipes. 
After that I started brainstorming and came up with the idea about 'what's in your fridge?'.

#### Day 2
I worked on my design document. This was about thinking about the more technical aspects of my app. 
I thought about how to design the UI's and make sure screens get properly connected. I created all activities with buttons/text etc. 
This was my advanced sketch at day 2:

### Day 3
Thinking about the app being user friendly, I made some changes. 

First of all I decided to try and create one SearchActivity which handles the API search as well as the DB search. 
This way the user doesn't need to search twice but get's both results at once. 

Next to this, I made some name changes in the activities. 
Also there was the GroceryActivity which shows a GroceryList. I thought of creating a function where the user can add a found recipe to their favorites. 
At the first screen it'll be possible to see your favorites so you can remember them locally on your phone to look up in te future.

The app sketch changed to this:

After changing the technical aspects I started programming this set up in Android Studio. 

### Day 4
Still working on connecting all the screens and creating buttons etc. Also making sure the Food2Fork API works. 

### Day 5
The API works! The APISearchRequest data is printed containing the name, id and image urls. The next step is to use this for a APIRecipeRequest. Because then the complete recipes will be requested so the ingredients etc too. This is the data that will be shown in the ResultsActivity.

### Day 6
Improving the app by it's ResultsActivity. The names of the recipes already show but the images won't. Working on it.
It turned out the urls for the images were 'http' instead of 'https'. To solve it I splitted the image_url and added a 's' inbetween the 'p' and ':'. Might report it on Food2Forks Github page ;)

Also I decided to do a GridView in the UI from ResultsActivity instead of a Listview.

### Day 7
Working on completing the recipe requests for the alpha version this week. 
The GetRequest works too. The data only had to be put in textviews etc to show details of the recipe in the RecipeActivity. After this i'll start working on using a DB to add users recipes. 

### Day 8
Both requests work now. Now updating RecipeActivity to show a recipe when clicked on it. Also creating the UsersRecipeRequest which makes is possible to request the usersrecipes from a local server. Decided to use rester as a local host because i've used it before and SQlite is local so the users wouldn't be able to search it theirselfs. 

### Day 9
Today and tomorrow i'm gonna work on the users recipe's database. Looking at other apps and their user interface. It can give inspiration as well as looking for points of improvement that I can use in my app. 

### Day 10
At first I wanted to make two search options. One to search for users recipes and one for the online recipes (API). This wouldn't be a nice solution and certainly not very user friendly because it would require a user two search twice but seperately. So i worked on merging the results of the search in the API and database. 

### Day 11
It workes! At first I made it possible to add recipes to the database. After that I wanted the app to show both results at one search. The app shows results from the API as well as the database at once. Still need to implement the filter on the database search. 
Unfortunateley it's not possible to let the user add their own image. That's why user recipes will show with a standard picture so that they are also distinguish from the API recipes.

Lot's of improvement. RecipeActivity is almost done and shows the clicked recipe with it's details. It took some time because it was the first time I used data from a request but not using it in an Adapter. But it works! Also it's possible to click a button that redirects the user to the source_url with the complete recipe.
Used the splitting method from http to https again because I haven't found another solution for it and the TA accepted it like this.

### Day 12
At first I had a really good start. Then I realized I had to make something to make sure the RecipeActivity could recognize whether the user clicked on an UserRecipe or API recipe. I started off quite enthousiasmic but then I messed up and didn't get it back as it was. So I had to go back to my last commit, which was were I left off yesterday. So I created a Recipe tag so it knows to do the right request. Also I created a GetRequest for the user recipes. This is not done yet. The tag does work for API recipes already.
Also have worked on the next and previous button in the ResultsActivity but not done yet. 
Update: thursday night. Both requests work and data is received by RecipeActivity. Difficulty was the difference in format from the user recipes and api recipes. Almost done only the ingredients have to me passed correctly to the RecipeActivity.
I've reached my maximum of API calls, which is a total of 50. So tomorrow i'm gonna work on the next and previous button, invisibility at some point for some buttons, filtering user recipes with searchrequest.
The API recipes get a source url which redirects them to the online page with the total recipe. I created a button to redirect the user and this button will be available when a user has clicked on a user recipe. This is because there is no source url included with those.

### Day 13
I decided to get rid of the MainActivity because it's only useful to have a startscreen with options on a game app. On my app it's most important to use the search option and next to that the option to upload your own recipes. So the mainactivity is not as usefull and can be deleted. Instead of the mainscreen, the searchactivity will be the first screen and the user will directly be able to search or upload their own recipe. 

The next en previous buttons in the ResultsActivity both work. Also the previous button only shows up after the user gets on page 1 so it can go back to page 0. On page 0 there is no previous button needed.
Also I created a recipetag to distinguish API recipes from user recipes. The API recipes have a "isAPI' tag which is true and recipes false. Depending on what the user clicks on, the app knows which request has to be performed.

Also based on some feedback I received, the app will show a toastmessage in case it didn't find any matches with the users searchword. This is important because someone could be searching with some very special species of fruit and the app wouldn't find anything.

It's not possible to do a filtered searchRequest for user recipes based on the users searchword. I asked the TA and she concluded it's not possible with the rester database i'm using. That is very unfortunate because it can't search for partly matching recipes. It would only work if the user would accidentally put the exact same content as what's in the users recipe.


### Day 14 dinsdag
I added a floating action button in ResultsActivity so the user can also upload their own from there. Also the overall font style changed to one I downloaded called 'actor'. Also the background of the grid changed to a little lighter shade of grey than the apps background. This way there is a bit more contrast to the recipes which I find better looking. 

About the SearchActivity, which is now the main screen. I changed quite a lot about the UI like the colors and logo. The colors are fiercer and stand out more (in my opinion). Because this is the mainscreen now, I felt like it should pop out once you open the app. 

Next to this I had this idea about wanting to involve social media with my app. So I did, and I created an instragram page for my project. On the SearchActivity there is an Instagram button which will redirect the user to my instagram page called 'yourfridge_app' :)

Also the upload button changed, I felt like it didn't match the rest of the page anymore so it became an icon too. 
After letting a friend using the app I noticed she would click on the image in RecipeActivity. This made me think about an option to get a closer view on it. So I created a method when the user clicks on the image, a bigger version of it will become visible in the activity, along with a closing button. This way the user can have a better look at the recipes image.
Also she uploaded her own recipe, and when she pressed the button to upload, I noticed the edittexts don't clear automatically. I added this to the method so now the app handles this itself and the user is able to eventually add more recipes.

Finally I cleaned my code again and added a few last comments to some new methods. 

### Day 15 woensdag
Today I worked on the process book. I made a lot of process and noted everything but didn't have time to actually write about it. 

I changed the standard image which comes with user recipes. The new icon matches the theme of the app much better. Depending on the kind of recipe, there's a method that makes sure to load the image url when it's an API recipe. 

Also took care of landscape variation.
