What’s in your fridge?

By Levy van der Linde

- Problem

No inspiration on what to cook?
This app recommends several recipes built on what’s in your fridge!


- Solution

The only thing you have to do is search for recipes by the things that you can find in your fridge. 

Next to this, if you’ve found a nice recipe, it’s possible to make a grocerylist. In case you just want to find a recipe and buy the ingredients, you can search for anything. 

The main idea is to make it possible to search for recipes based on the users searchterm.
Some possible additional ideas:
-	Create a crocerylist of the ingredients
-	Add your own recipe
-	Share your ideas via social media

- Prerequisites

I am going to use an API with recipes. Here are some links to what I’ve found so far:
https://www.food2fork.com/about/api
https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api
http://api2.bigoven.com/web/documentation/recipes

Review on similar apps:
There are other apps that make it possible to find recipes on a searchterm. That’s why I’ve thought of some additions to make my app more extensive.
